Fan Fields 2 - An Ingress fanfield planner plugin for IITC

This is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/Heistergand/fanfields2) (archived) project from [@Heistergand](https://github.com/Heistergand), who has since stopped playing Ingress. My intention with this fork is to fix minor bugs and add minor features. Please see [57Cell's video](https://youtu.be/Z9TPlpnMYyI) for an overview of how this plugin works.
